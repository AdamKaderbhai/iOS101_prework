## Apps that I like : 
1.) Duolingo
- It has a streak tracker tracker and an option to add a widget that lets me check my streak to keep me going.
- It shows how long I spent doing a lesson.
- Sends funny and personalized reminders if I haven't taken a lesson in a day.

2.) The Fitness App
- Has nice visual ring feature to show my progess for each activity
- Offers a variety of training tutorials to guide my workouts.

3.) Muscle Wiki
- Very convenient, I just tap on a muscle on the interactive figure, and it provides different exercises of various types.
- Lets me create personalized workouts based on the exercises I like.



## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
I want to create an app that helps users build and maintain healthy habits while staying motivated. The app will allow users to create a daily checklist of tasks for personal well-being, such as exercising, meditating, or drinking enough water. It will send reminders throughout the day to keep users on track and celebrate their progress with notifications and personalized messages when they complete tasks. Additionally, the app will include a journal feature for daily reflection, a calendar to schedule and organize habits, and the ability to sync habits directly to the calendar for better time management. The goal is to make it easy and rewarding for users to stay consistent with their goals and improve their overall well-being.


## Notes

For me Connecting UI to Logic was a bit challenging.
